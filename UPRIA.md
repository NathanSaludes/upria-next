Future Ideas:

1. Project Onboarding
	Create a page dedicated to upria documentation. This will serve as the foundation and starting point for new developers who will be working on the project.

	The content should have the following
	- Outline what upria is and its purpose
	- Where resources are located (Slack channel, Notion pages)
	- Setting up the project
    	- How to install and bootstrap the project locally

2. CMS
   All the static parts of the website should be managed from a CMS (Content Management System) so editors can freely update static assets without the need to update the code. You may use open source CMS like Payload or Strapi.

	 Static parts of the UPRIA website may include:
	 - The main heading text of the landing page.
	 - Hero Image
	 - Navigation Links and Labels
	 - Brand Logo
	 - Legal (Copyrights, Terms & Condiions, Privacy Policy)
	 - Blogs
	 - Promotional Banners
